	<span class="bodyBold"><br>History:</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="bodyTxt">Since 1988, Dr. Greenleaf has been in private practice as a licensed psychologist.  She's developed psycho- physiological techniques & strategies to help people take control over their lives &ndash; whether to give a lecture, manage medical conditions related to an injury or medical diagnosis, resolve inter-personal conflicts or optimize performance in sports, the arts or business.
	<br/>
	<br/>

	Dr. Greenleaf started her education as a dancer studying relaxation techniques & ideokinesis.  These techniques, which include mental imagery to enhance performance and alter physiological responses, are the basis of mind-body work she does with dancers, athletes and medical patients.
	<br/>
	<br/>

	In the mid-1970's, she began intensive training in the hypnotic modality which includes formal hypnosis, self-hypnosis, guided imagery, relaxation techniques & visualization.
	<br/>
	<br/>

	When Dr. Greenleaf was in the Dept. of Nursing at The Hospital of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, she worked bedside with patients to alleviate problems related to medical conditions. She covered every unit in the hospital from orthopedic & cardiac surgery to diagnostic procedures & oncology.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	
 	In 1986, she was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  She held two positions: Director of Human Support for Patients in the Dept. of Nursing and Director of Training in Medical Hypnosis in the Dept. of Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
 	<br/>
 	<br/>

	In the medical field, she is trained to help patients & their families activate healing, improve recovery & find practical solutions to cope with every phase of treatment, recovery or loss.
